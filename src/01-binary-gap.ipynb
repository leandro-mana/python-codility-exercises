    "A **binary gap** within a positive integer `N` is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N.\n",

    "For example, number `9` has binary representation `1001` and contains a binary gap of length `2`. The \n",
    "number `529` has binary representation `1000010001` and contains two binary gaps: one of length `4` and one of length `3`. The number `20` has binary representation `10100` and contains one binary gap of length `1`. The number `15` has binary representation `1111` and has no binary gaps. The number `32` has binary representation `100000` and has no binary gaps.\n",

    "\n",
    "that, given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap. The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given `N = 1041` the function should return `5`, because N has binary representation `10000010001` and so its longest binary gap is of length `5`. Given `N = 32` the function should return `0`, because N has binary representation `100000` and thus no binary gaps.\n",
